CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
StyleSheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
Decoration

--File:
Can have an External Style Sheet, Internal StyleSheet or an Inline StyleSheet
Make a folder named 'css' and put any css files in there
the main file should be 'main.css' or 'style.css'
Load External StyleSheet: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css" type="text/css"> or <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">
Internal StyleSheet: <style></style>
Inline StyleSheet: style:"color:blue" (as an attribute to an element)

**will be using external stylesheet on html** (so, might be different if you are using something else)


--Syntax:
selector {
    property: propertyValue; 
}
property propertyValue pair is called a declaration
the whole structure is called a ruleset (often referred to as rule)


--specificity:
IDs
Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes
Elements, and pseudo-elements



--notes
if the declaration is incorrect it will just be ignored
a . in front of were the selector goes will style a class
set a class with attribute class="class"

a # in front of were the selector goes will style a id (#)
set a id with attribute id="identifier"

can group selectors with commas in between
without commas in between will look for secondSelector in firstSelector (p em {} will style em in paragraphs)

* selects everything
cascading, top to bottom, which ever declaration is last over rules any other past declaration with the same selector (classes can only be changed with )
specificity, for example: if you, make a class called grey with color grey and you later on change the color of paragraphs to green, any paragraph with the grey class will still be grey since it is more specific

inheritance is were another element inherits properties from its parent element (example: body is parent to most other elements)
font elements typically do not inherit font properties

!important overrides everything



--units:
px pixels (USE THIS, IT THE BEST ONE)
cm centimeters
% percent, size depending on the page size (usually used for width and height)
rem ? (font only), the size relative to default size set by the browser (1 = browser font size, 2 = double browser font size) (browser font size can be overwritten by the html selector, rem still works)
ch characters, size determined by the size of the character '0'
(others exist but are mostly irrelevant)

font-family: font style
font-size: text size
background-color: background color (color)
background: background ()
boarder: boarder (size, type, color)
padding: space between the element and the boarder of the element
